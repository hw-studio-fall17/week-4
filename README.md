# Intro to Javascript
##### At the top of `script.js`
* Write a variable called `myName` and set it equal to your name.
* Write a variable called `myAge` and set it equal to your age.
* Write a variable called `myFavoriteColor` and set it equal to your favorite color.
* Write a variable called `myFavoriteHobby` and set it equal to your favorite hobby!
* Open index.html in Chrome.
* If you see a message that looks like this...

### Not working? Here's a common mistake checklist!
1. Did you follow the correct syntax?
  * EXAMPLE:  `var exampleVariable = "This is an example variable."`
2. Did you use " " when making a string (text)?
3. Did you name EVERY variable EXACTLY like these:
  * `myName`
  * `myAge`
  * `myFavoriteColor`
  * `myFavoriteHobby`
3. Did you save and refresh?

### If you finish early....
* Make up two more variables!
* We are using the `alert()` function to create the popup. Try to add your new variable to the popup text.
